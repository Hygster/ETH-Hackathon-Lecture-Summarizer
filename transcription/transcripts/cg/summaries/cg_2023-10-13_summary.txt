# In-Depth Summaries

## Monte Carlo Integration
Monte Carlo integration is a method used to approximate integrals by using random sampling. It is extensively used in rendering algorithms. The lecture covers the mathematical concepts and sampling techniques involved in Monte Carlo integration. One example discussed is the integration of the function e^(sin(3x^2)) using the Monte Carlo method. The method can also be extended to compute integrals over a generalized interval from A to B, requiring the transformation of random numbers generated to fit within the desired range and adjusting the probability density. [Summary 3]

## Random Variables and Probability Distributions
Random variables are denoted by capital letters and have a cumulative distribution function (CDF). The probability density function (PDF) is the derivative of the CDF and must be non-negative and integrate to one over a given domain. The lecture discusses the use of uniform random variables, particularly the canonical uniform distribution. [Summary 2]

## Monte Carlo Estimation
Monte Carlo estimation involves dividing the function by the sampling PDF and averaging the results. It is an unbiased estimator, and its expectation equals the true integral being computed. The convergence rate of Monte Carlo estimation is one over the square root of n, meaning that to reduce the error by a factor of two, four times as many samples are needed. The lecture also introduces the concept of sampling random variables and discusses techniques for generating samples that come from a desired distribution. Examples of sampling a disk and a sphere are given. [Summary 4]

## Area-Preserving Sampling
Area-preserving sampling is an important technique for sampling objects like spheres and hemispheres. By rejecting samples outside the desired shape and normalizing the remaining samples, a uniform distribution can be achieved on the surface of the object. This lecture emphasizes the importance of correctly sampling for the desired area distribution. [Summary 5]

## Sampling Techniques in Computer Graphics
Sampling techniques play a crucial role in rendering tasks, especially when dealing with volumetric effects such as smoke or clouds. 2D sampling is insufficient for capturing 3D volumes, and more decisions need to be made to reduce variance. The lecture introduces the concept of stratified sampling, where the integration domain is subdivided into smaller regions and a random sample is taken from each region. This approach can lower variance and is a step towards more advanced quasi Monte Carlo methods. The lecture also mentions the importance of considering how random numbers are generated for sampling to avoid cluttered or empty areas. [Summary 7]
