# In-Depth Summaries

## Topic 1: Materials and Microfaceted Models
In this lecture, the speaker introduces the topic of materials and microfaceted models as a way to represent materials in computer graphics. Different materials have different responses to light, and they can be represented using a BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function). This function allows us to describe how light is reflected from different materials. (Summary 1)

## Topic 2: Ideal Reflection and Refraction
The lecture explains the principles of ideal reflection and refraction. Ideal specular reflection follows Fermat's principle of least time, meaning that the path taken by light is the one that minimizes the time it takes to travel from the source to the viewer. The angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence for an ideal mirror. Snell's law governs the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction for ideal reflection and refraction. (Summary 2)

## Topic 3: Total Internal Reflection and Fresnel Equations
Total internal reflection occurs when light passes from a medium with a higher index of refraction to one with a lower index of refraction. The lecture also discusses the Fresnel equations, which determine how much light is reflected and transmitted by materials. These equations take into account the angle of incidence and the properties of the materials. At grazing angles, materials appear more reflective due to Fresnel reflection. (Summary 4)

## Topic 4: Evolution of Material Models in Computer Graphics
The lecture provides an overview of the evolution of material models used in computer graphics. Earlier models were empirical and less physically accurate, while more recent models are either physically accurate or physically plausible. Physically accurate models are used in industry, while physically plausible models relax certain assumptions to achieve desired effects in films. Microfaceted theory is currently considered the state of the art in material representation. This theory considers materials as having jagged edges made up of facets and defines the BRDF using microfaceted distribution, Fresnel term, and shadowing and masking term. (Summary 5)

## Topic 5: Components and Limitations of the Microfacet Model
The lecture dives deeper into the components and limitations of the microfacet model for material rendering. The components of the microfacet model include microfacet distribution, Fresnel term, and shadowing and masking term. The distribution chosen can vary depending on the desired effect. Shadowing refers to obstruction from the light direction, while masking refers to obstruction from the view direction. Equations are available for calculating the term that represents shadowing and masking. However, the microfacet model has limitations, especially in accounting for interreflections within peaks and valleys. The lecture also mentions extensions to the model for anisotropic reflection, coated materials, and retro reflections, providing examples of retro reflectors in paint and shoes. (Summary 6)
