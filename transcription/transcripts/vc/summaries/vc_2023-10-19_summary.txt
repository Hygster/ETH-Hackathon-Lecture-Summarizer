# In-Depth Summaries

## Unitary Transforms and Image Analysis

In this topic, the lecture discusses unitary transforms and their application in image analysis. It starts by focusing on representing photo collections as vectors in a high-dimensional space (Summary 1). The lecture emphasizes centering the distribution by subtracting the average and choosing a rank k approximation to capture significant singular values. Next, the lecture explores the importance of differentiating meaningful changes in the data from irrelevant changes, such as noise or lighting variations, when comparing images for recognition. To address this, the lecture introduces the fitting of ellipses to represent within-class and between-class variations, aiming to maximize meaningful changes and minimize irrelevant changes. This approach can be solved using the generalized eigenvector problem or singular value decomposition. The lecture acknowledges that more complex methods are available but focuses on principled baseline methods.

## Inverse of a Matrix and Image Analysis

This uses on the inverse of a matrix and its relevance to image analysis (Summary 2). It explains that for a non-zero singular value, the inverse can be obtained by taking the reciprocal of that singular value. The lecture also discusses the concept of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Fisher linear discriminant, using a simple example of two dimensions and different classes. PCA identifies the direction of the biggest variation, while Fisher linear discriminant focuses on the direction that represents the difference between classes. The lecture further highlights the importance of considering lighting variations and within-class variations when analyzing images and applying dimension reduction techniques such as PCA and Fisher faces.

## Albedo and Object Recognition

The lecture delves into the concept of albedo and its impact on object recognition (Summary 3). Albedo refers to how much light is reflected by a surface. The lecture states that the brightness of an object is proportional to the amount of light present and the object's albedo. It also explains that linear models can effectively capture most of the variation in light but fails to account for factors like shadows. The lecture highlights the use of principal component analysis in recognizing objects from different viewpoints. It concludes by mentioning the need for more complex models when the space is non-linear due to objects undergoing 360-degree rotations.

## PCA and Image Compression

This uses on the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in image compression (Summary 4). The lecture explains that PCA can be used to project images into a lower-dimensional space, specifically a three-dimensional space in this case. The lecture also mentions the use of PCA in recognizing and analyzing faces. Additionally, the lecture discusses the relationship between PCA and the Fourier transform, demonstrating how PCA of natural images can produce similar results to the Fourier transform. The lecture also touches on the artifacts and limitations of JPEG compression and highlights the contrast sensitivity curve in human visual perception.

## Image Compression and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)

In this topic, the lecture explores image compression techniques, with a focus on the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) (Summary 5). The lecture discusses the variation of contrast and the human eye's sensitivity to different frequencies in images. It explains that the human eye is less sensitive to higher frequencies, which can be leveraged for compression in JPEG. The lecture introduces the DCT, which decomposes an image into coefficients representing low and high frequencies. It also mentions the use of a quantization matrix to reduce the number of bits used to represent the coefficients and highlights the zigzag scan pattern to describe the coefficients efficiently. The lecture concludes by mentioning the encoding of the DC component relative to the previous block.
